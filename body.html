                                 <p>Before going to start your training and nutrition regimen, it's important for you to
                                   understand what is your body type? The three basic human body types are the endomorph,
                                  the mesomorph, and the ectomorph. Knowing your body type will be going to help you in 
                                  the long run. You can acquire the correct workout plan and diet planfor your body type, 
                                  and by doing so you'll be going to set your realistic and attainable goals.</p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p>Is it an ectomorph, mesomorph or endomorph?</p>

                                  <p>According to your ectomorph, endomorph or mesomorph body type, your training program
                                     should be arranged according to the diet program you have planned. In other words, 
                                     create a calorie surplus in a weight-gain training program, or create a calorie 
                                     deficit in a weight-loss training program and lose weight.</p>

                                     <h2 class="h2" style="color:#f9ac54";>BODYBUILDING - STRATEGY</h2>
                                     <p>In order to achieve muscle growth (hypertrophy), bodybuilders focus in three main lines of action:</p>
                                     <p><b>1.</b> Weight training</p>
                                     <p><b>2.</b> nutrition</p>
                                     <p><b>3.</b> Adequate rest</p>
                                     <p>The type of weight training done by bodybuilders is meant to create microscopic tears in the muscle, 
                                      forcing the body to repair the muscles and expand the storage capacity. The repairs cause the muscles 
                                      to grow, a process known as hypertrophy. Combining a suitable workout with a high-protein diet and plenty 
                                      of rest in off-times will ensure effective results.</p>
                                      <br>
                                      <h1>HOW MUCH WEIGHT SHOULD I LIFT TO GAIN MUSCLE?</h1>
                                      <p>For hypertrophy, 3 to 6 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions per exercise with a moderate load (60% to 85% of
                                         one-rep max) is ideal. More advanced individuals looking to further develop muscle mass can perform 
                                         3 to 6 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions at 70% to 85% of one-rep max.</p>
                                         <p>Beginners are advised to start with light weights and focus on proper technique. Building a strong 
                                          foundation and gradually progressing in weight and intensity will help you safely and effectively 
                                          achieve your muscle gain goals. </p>
                                         <p>Your one rep max (1RM) is the maximum amount of weight that you can lift to complete one repetition.</p>
                                         <h2 class="h2" style="color:#f9ac54";>HOW MANY SETS AND REPS SHOULD I DO?</h2>
                                         <p>Different training organizations, such as the American Council on Exercise (ACE) or the National 
                                          Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), have slightly different models for each training goal. But they 
                                          follow the same general guidelines.</p>
                                          <div class="sc">
                                        <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-11-18 184155.png">
                                        </div>
                                          <p>Three important variables of hypertrophy training are volume, intensity, and frequency. Volume 
                                            refers to the number of muscles worked, exercises, sets, and reps during a single session. Intensity 
                                            refers to the amount of work required to achieve the training and is proportional to the mass of the 
                                            weights being lifted. Frequency refers to how many workout sessions are performed per week. On average, 
                                            it takes two days for muscles to recover. A training frequency of two or three times per week has 
                                            greater effect on muscle size than once per week, whereas training volume has more effect on muscle 
                                            strength than training frequency.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <h2 class="h2" style="color:#f9ac54";>RECOMMENDED VOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY, SET AND REP RANGE FOR HYPERTROPHY.</h2>
                                            <p> Intensity: 60-85% of 1 rep max</p>
                                            <p>Volume: 3-6 sets per exercise / 6-12 repetitions per set</p>
                                            <p>Frequency: 2 to 3 days per week of training has been
                                               effective in increasing musclehypertrophy. Higher frequencies 
                                               may be used to fully maximize hypertrophy.</p>
                                               <p>If you are doing weight training for the first time, the volume and intensity are kept low, the 
                                                priority is to aim to do the exercises right.</p>
                                                <br>
                                                <h2 class="h2"  style="color:#f9ac54";>HOW MANY DAYS A WEEK SHOULD I WORKOUT?</h2>
                                                  <p>To get the expected results, it is important to train smart, but also to give your body a 
                                                  chance to recover properly. Proper recovery includes, among other things, a suitable diet and enough 
                                                  recovery time to give the body time to adapt to the muscular work to which it is subjected, as well 
                                                  as to improve your condition after each session.</p>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <h3>FOR MUSCLE GAIN</h3>
                                                  <p>Research findings support the notion that working muscle groups twice a week leads to more substantial
                                                     gains in both muscle size and strength compared to training them only once a week. As a result, 
                                                     incorporating a minimum of two weekly sessions for the same muscle group could be a strategic approach 
                                                     to maximize your training outcomes. </p>
                                                     <p>For the same muscle group, 48 hours of recovery between sessions is usually sufficient. Remember that 
                                                      muscles are damaged during training and develop during rest. You can train 7 days a week, but you can't 
                                                      work the same muscle group. For example; If you work the chest on Monday, the legs on Tuesday, and the 
                                                      shoulders on Wednesday, you will have enough rest time for the next chest workout.</p>

                                                           These exercises are known for their efficiency in building overall strength and muscle mass. 
                                                           Compound exercises are highly recommended for beginners because they provide a strong foundation by 
                                                           developing functional strength and enhancing overall muscle coordination. They also burn more
